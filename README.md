# Ensemble Verification Practical Example
Repo to support the Reed Group blog post [here](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2024/06/17/ensemble-forecasting-verification/) which covers aspects of ensemble forecast verification techniques. The data in this repository are from NOAA/NWS 30 year Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast Service (HEFS) forecasts for the Feather-Yuba system (YRS) for the Lake Oroville inflow (ORDC1) site. These hydrologic forecasts are forced with the NOAA/NCEP GEFSv12 reforecasts of TMAX, TMIN, and PRECIP.

The practical plotting example is contained in the following script with comments indicating where users can modify the parameters:

Functions for ensemble verification and miscellaneous utility functions are contained here:
